# Children disproportionately exposed to attributable heat stress days

Work in progress (Pietroiusti et al. in prep). 

Calculate gridscale attributable heat stress days and assess whether there is a disproportionate burden on children vs. adults, based on GCMs and reanalysis. 

## Additional necessary code:

Code for preprocessing of demographic data is available at https://github.com/rosapietroiusti/dem4cli. Additional code necessary for the calculation of wet bulb temperature is available at <NEWT>, and for non-stationary distribution modelling at <dist_cov>. 

## Data availability 

All data used in the analysis is publicly available: reanalysis data (https://doi.org/10.48364/ISIMIP.982724.2) and CMIP6 climate model data bias-adjusted and statistically downscaled (https://doi.org/10.48364/ISIMIP.842396.1) are available through the ISIMIP data repository. Indoor WBGT data produced in this analysis will also be made available in the ISIMIP data repository.

Gridded population reconstructions (https://doi.org/10.48364/ISIMIP.889136.2) and projections (DOI missing!) are also available through the ISIMIP data repository. Country masks are available via ISIpedia (https://github.com/ISI-MIP/isipedia-countries). Cohort size data is available from the Wittgenstein Center Data Explorer v2 (http://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/wcde-v2/). SSP-RCP pathways are available through the AR6 scenario explorer hosted by IIASA (https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ar6)
